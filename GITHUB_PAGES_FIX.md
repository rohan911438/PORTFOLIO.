# 🔧 GITHUB PAGES CONFIGURATION FIX

## ✅ **Status Confirmed**:
- ✅ GitHub Actions deployment: **SUCCESS** (Green tick)
- ✅ gh-pages branch: **EXISTS** (Files deployed)
- ❌ GitHub Pages settings: **NOT CONFIGURED CORRECTLY**

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE FIX** (2 minutes):

### **Step 1: Configure GitHub Pages Source**

1. **Go to your repository**: `https://github.com/rohan911438/PORTFOLIO`

2. **Click "Settings" tab** (at the top of the repository)

3. **Scroll down to "Pages" section** (in the left sidebar)

4. **Configure the source**:
   - Under "Source": Select **"Deploy from a branch"**
   - Under "Branch": Select **"gh-pages"** (not main)
   - Under "Folder": Select **"/ (root)"**
   - Click **"Save"**

### **Step 2: Wait and Test**
- Wait **2-3 minutes** for GitHub Pages to rebuild
- Visit: `https://rohan911438.github.io/PORTFOLIO/`
- Clear browser cache if needed: `Ctrl + F5`

## 🎯 **Why This Happens**:

GitHub Pages defaults to serving from the `main` branch, but our deployment workflow pushes the built files to the `gh-pages` branch. We need to tell GitHub Pages to serve from the correct branch.

## 📋 **Visual Guide**:

```
GitHub Repository → Settings → Pages

Source: [Deploy from a branch ▼]
Branch: [gh-pages ▼] [/ (root) ▼] [Save]
```

## ✅ **Expected Result**:

After configuring the source, your portfolio will show:
- 🏠 Professional home section with your photo
- 🧠 Skills section with ML progress bars  
- 💼 14+ machine learning projects
- 🎓 Education timeline with GCECT
- 📧 Contact form with your email
- 🌙 Consistent dark theme

## 🔄 **If Still Not Working**:

1. **Double-check branch**: Ensure "gh-pages" is selected (not "main")
2. **Wait longer**: Sometimes takes up to 10 minutes
3. **Clear cache**: Hard refresh with `Ctrl + Shift + R`
4. **Check URL**: Ensure you're visiting `https://rohan911438.github.io/PORTFOLIO/` (with trailing slash)

**Your portfolio is 100% ready - just needs the GitHub Pages source configured correctly!** 🌟
